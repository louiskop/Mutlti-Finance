# Mutlti-Finance
A React & Electron app, which uses local storage to manage created accounts. Transaction data is automatically forwarded to an email address from my phone. A scraper then gets all the data at this email address and processes the transactions
This is still in early development

## What I Learned
- Set up react and electron to run concurrently
- ipcMain and Channel messaging for communication between electron and react
- React and Css

## How to run
`npm run dev`
